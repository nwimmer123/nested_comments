#Closure Tree Gem

##Overview

This gem is good for making nested comments, setting up the comments as a linked list. It is not the easiest to work with, but I found a nice tutorial to walk me through it. Theor Github page is also very nicely documented. I picked this because a lot of sites use nested comments and I wanted to implement it in one of my own projects, and this is a not to hard way to impliment it.

Main point, is it makes it easier to grab your to make linked lists. You just tell it to do it, using their custom metod, when you run your new path in your controller. Pretty snazzy.
